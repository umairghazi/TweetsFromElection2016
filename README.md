# TweetsFromElection2016

### This project focuses on builiding a web application which fetches tweet from Twitter's Live Streaming API, stores it in
    a mongo database and using queries can find the data within the database. 

We decided to fetch the tweets about the US Presidential Elections 2016 as the topic is always trending on twitter these days 
with almost 20-25 tweets being posted about the topic every second.
